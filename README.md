## Description

When a user starts the application, they are prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. After entering the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, they are presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building the team.

If they select the engineer option, they are prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and are then taken back to the menu. If they select the intern option, then they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and are then taken back to the menu.

When a user decides to finish building the team, they exit the application and an html page is generated.

The application will be invoked by using the following command: **node index.js**
